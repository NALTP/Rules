In both cases the CRC will notify the rest of the captains for someone to second the motion unless a second has already come forward.
  - (3) Upon receipt of an official veto, the CRC will organize a vote amongst the captains in private through a form with a deadline for voting. The results will be announced at the stated deadline or when the final vote is cast, whichever occurs first.
  - (4) There may be more than one veto requested at one time. Timelines will be entirely at the discretion of the CRC.

### Article XIII - Appendix
  - (1) Teams are subject to punishment if their players or captains partake in any of the following: violation of the DBAD rule, spam on Discord, spam on Reddit, or any other action that breaks the NALTP rules.
  - (2) In the event of a forfeit of a match, the wins and losses will count as usual in the standings, with the cap differential for the winning and losing team being the third-largest positive and negative cap differential for all other matches that week, respectively. If only one game is forfeited, the cap differential will be the third-largest differential for that game of the week. (Ex. If Game 2 is a forfeit, the cap diff is that of all other Game 2's for that week.)
  - (3) The NALTP CRC may demand full access to a team's subreddit (including modmail), Discord, or other form of communication without needing to provide a reason, and shall be granted this access with speed.
  - (4) The CRC agrees that an attack against one or more of them on the subreddit, Discord, or any other public forum shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an attack occurs, each of them will assist the CRC Member or Members so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other CRC Members, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the CRC.
  - (5) Any player who becomes banned from playing TagPro will be ineligible to play in NALTP. They may remain on the roster and resume playing when they are no longer banned from TagPro. Playing on an alternate account to avoid the ban will result in league punishment and referral to the TagPro Moderators.
  - (6) The CRC has the right to interpret rules on a case-by-case basis for the sake of the league’s integrity and competitiveness.
