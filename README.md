          - (bb) The second, third and fourth add/drop periods will begin at the conclusion of default time games after week 1, week 2 and week 3, respectively. These periods will last approximately 48 hours and the CRC will announce when bidding opens and when bidding closes for each period.

        - (1) There will be no add/drop periods in the postseason.
    - (b) Add/drop process:

        - (2) Add/drops may be denied by the CRC due to availability restrictions or by the individual players receiving call-ups.

        - (1) Add/drops will be processed on a rolling, first come, first served basis.
          - (aa) Add/drops may be submitted to the CRC via direct messages or captains chat with an appropriate ping.
        - (2) The CRC will deny callups on the basis of availability restrictions, intentionally poor call-ups or anything else deemed relevant by the CRC.

            - (II) All teams will have the opportunity to make a bid on any eligible players in each stage of the the add/drop period. When a stage is complete, the players will be awarded to the team with the highest value bid.

### Article V - Player Restrictions

#### Section A - Proper Position Restrictions
  - (1) In the Major and Minor leagues, proper positions will be enforced for all players who list that they will play only one position ("Offense only" or "Defense only") in their signup.
    - (a) These restrictions will be communicated to the player and all captains prior to the relevant draft, with the ability to make changes pre-draft.
    - (b) A proper position indicates the side of the map a player will default to when there are no external influences on their decision making. Players with a proper position are not required to adhere to rigid guidelines and may often find themselves 'outside' their position when doing so is the best strategical play available to them.
    - (c) At their discretion the CRC may deem individual players ineligible for proper positions, in which case their signup will be locked as eligible for both positions.
      - (i) Any player who is ruled ineligible for a proper position may be removed from the draft entirely if the CRC determines that they are continuing to use positional preferences to manipulate their draft stock.
  - (2) In Novice league, proper positions for offense or defense will only be enforced if the player's most recent season in the position opposite their current signup resulted in a positional NISH of 70 or greater.
    - (a) Examples:
      - (i) A defender earns the 70 DNISH in the previous season and signs up with an offensive proper position. The position will be enforced.
      - (ii) A defender earns the 70 DNISH in the previous season and signs up with a defensive proper position. The position will not be enforced.
    - (b) If the player has never played a season where their primary position was the opposite position from their current signup, no restriction will be applied.

#### Section B - Scheduling Restrictions
  - (1) The CRC may enforce schedule restrictions on a player commensurate with the availability they indicate in their signup comments.
    - (a) These restrictions will be communicated to the player and all captains prior to the relevant draft, with the ability to make changes pre-draft.
    - (b) When missed dates are included in a player's signup, restrictions will be applied to those specific dates.
      - (i) Ex: Signup comment reads "I will miss 6/14-6/16 for a business trip", restriction applied is "Player is ineligible to play between 6/14 and 6/16."
      - (ii) Date range restrictions are inclusive of the days listed. In the above example, the player would not be eligible on 6/14, 6/15 or 6/16.
    - (c) Generic comments about missed time may result in a minutes restriction or game week restriction.
      - (i) Minute restrictions will be determined by subtracting the number of weeks a player will miss multiplied by 50 from the total number of available minutes in the given season.
        - (1) Ex: Signup comment reads "I will probably miss 2 weeks this season for underwater firelighting class", restriction applied is "Player is eligible for 250 minutes this season." Calculation - 350-(2x50).
        - (2) Minute restrictions are not linked to the specific week(s) a player is missing. If the player's conflict is resolved the restriction will still apply, but their captain may choose to play them and fulfill the restriction by sitting them a different week.
      - (ii) Game week restrictions will be assessed on the appropriate game week at the CRC's discretion.
        - (1) Ex: Signup comment reads "I will miss week 5 games", restriction applied is "Player is ineligible to play week 5 games."
        - (2) Game week restrictions are treated as a date range restriction, applied from the Friday prior to the default game time through the following Thursday after the default game time.

    - (a) These restrictions will be communicated to the player and all captains prior to the relevant draft, with the ability to make changes pre-draft.
    - (b) A scrim is defined as any private group with 2 or more players from the same roster in the group.
      - (i) This applies even if the players from the same roster are playing on different teams, in an OFM, etc.
      - (ii) Example: Players A, B, C and D are rostered on Team 1. If player A has a scrim restriction, they cannot play in any private group with players B, C or D at any point.

#### Section C - Whistleblowing
  - (1) Any person who has proof or suspicion of cheating in any way should send a detailed message to the CRC, or message an individual CRC member. If requested, commissioners will not disclose the name of the whistleblower. There is also a whistleblower form on the current info hub for the season.
  - (2) Any person who has proof or suspects all CRC members of cheating in any way should send a detailed message to any/all captains.
  - (3) Serious accusations of cheating are prohibited in any public setting without first conferring with multiple captains or CRC members.

#### Section D - Stock Manipulation
  - (1) Draft stock:
    - (a) Manipulation includes, but is not limited to: lying about availability, lying about ping or location, providing any other false information in signups, providing captains with different information, or making concerted efforts to land on a specific team.
    - (b) If a captain asks a player if they want to play for them, the player is allowed to say no. This includes interest forms, direct messages, or any other form of communication. However, signup comments or messages sent to captains through any forum indicating that the player will be unlikely to attend most or all games will result in the signup being removed.
    - (c) If a player informs a captain that they do not want to play for them without being solicited by the captain, it will be considered manipulation.
  - (2) Trade stock:
    - (a) Players determined to be manipulating to alter their trade value may also be punished. Teams who benefit from this may be punished as well.
      - (i) Giving captains an ultimatum to trade you is not acceptable. For example, “Trade me or I’m ghosting” is a bannable offense.
      - (ii) If there is a problem with a team, you can always ask for a trade and explain your reasoning to the captain. However, you signed up to participate in the league and will be expected to do so regardless of which captain drafts you or what team you end up on.

  - (2) In the event of a forfeit of a match, the wins and losses will count as usual in the standings, with the cap differential for the winning and losing team being the third-largest positive and negative cap differential for all other matches that week, respectively. If only one game is forfeited, the cap differential will be the third-largest differential for that game of the week. (Ex. If Game 2 is a forfeit, the cap diff is that of all other Game 2's for that week.)

  - (4) The CRC agrees that an attack against one or more of them on the subreddit, Discord, or any other public forum shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an attack occurs, each of them will assist the CRC Member or Members so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other CRC Members, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the CRC.
  - (5) Any player who becomes banned from playing TagPro will be ineligible to play in NALTP. They may remain on the roster and resume playing when they are no longer banned from TagPro.
