      - (viii) A bid with a value of zero TCA on a specific player is valid, so long as it is still accompanied by a player drafted at auction. TCA must be used in whole numbers.
      - (ix) Free agents who receive no bids will be progressed to the second snake draft.
    - (e) Second Snake Draft:

        - (6) Eligible co-captains seeking entry into Novice league must agree to enter into the free agency process, and are thus stripped of their title unless claimed by the team in which they are a co-captain. If a co-captain refuses to play for another team, they may face removal from the league on the grounds of collusion with their original team. Free agency results may also be adjusted accordingly.
        - (7) Captains who were playing in, and are dropped from, Minor league are ineligible for Novice league unless their team possesses a potential TCA bid large enough to guarantee their acquisition at the time of the primary free agency period.

### Article V - Proper Position and Scheduling Restrictions.

#### Section A - Proper Positions
  - (1) In the Major and Minor leagues, proper positions will be enforced for all players who list that they will play only one position ("Offense only" or "Defense only") in their signup.
    - (a) A proper position indicates the side of the map a player will default to when there are no external influences on their decision making. Players with a proper position are not required to adhere to rigid guidelines and may often find themselves 'outside' their position when doing so is the best strategical play available to them.
    - (b) At their discretion the CRC may deem individual players ineligible for proper positions, in which case their signup will be locked as eligible for both positions. 
      - (i) Any player who is ruled ineligible for a proper position may be removed from the draft entirely if the CRC determines that they are continuing to use positional preferences to manipulate their draft stock.
  - (2) In Novice league, proper positions for offense or defense will only be enforced if the player's most recent season in the position opposite their current signup resulted in a positional NISH of 70 or greater.
    - (a) Examples:
      - (i) A defender earns the 70 DNISH in the previous season and signs up with an offensive proper position. The position will be enforced.
      - (ii) A defender earns the 70 DNISH in the previous season and signs up with a defensive proper position. The position will not be enforced.
    - (b) If the player has never played a season where their primary position was the opposite position from their current signup, no restriction will be applied.
    
#### Section B - Scheduling Restrictions
  - (1) The CRC may enforce minute restrictions on a player commensurate with the availability they indicate in their signup comments.
    - (a) These minute restrictions will be communicated to the player and all captains prior to the relevant draft.
    - (b) Minute restrictions will be determined by subtracting the number of weeks a player will miss multipled by 50 from the total number of available minutes in the given season.
      - (i) Ex: If a player is missing 1 week in a 6 week season, they will be given a 250 minute restriction (300-(1x50)).
      - (ii) Minute restrictions are not linked to the specific week(s) a player is missing. If the player's conflict is resolved the restriction will still apply, but their captain may choose to play them and fulfill the restriction by sitting them a different week.

  - (3) If any member of the CRC is personally involved or their team is involved in a dispute that needs a ruling they will be forced to recuse themselves from the relevant CRC discussions, and subsequent vote. The CRC can, at their discretion, question these recused members if they have inquiries during their investigation.
    - (a) In the event of an even number of voting members, a tied vote will be considered failed. 
  - (4) Any rule change that will affect an upcoming or ongoing season is available for veto by the relevant GMs or Captains of the affected season.
  - (5) Changes to CRC structure can only be made through CRC vote, an independent committee and/or public referendum. These changes are not available for veto.

#### Section C - Vetoes
  - (1) If the captains wish to overrule a rule change or decision made by the CRC it must be done through an official veto.
    - (a) Captains' vetos may only be used to undo new rules and/or rulings made by the CRC.
    - (b) New rules and/or rulings may not be generated by captains' veto.
    - (c) Trades accepted by the CRC are not eligible for captains' veto.
  - (2) To submit a request for an official veto there must be a ping to the CRC in the captains chat or a direct message to a CRC member with the specific decision to be vetoed and clarification that the request is not in jest. In both cases the CRC will notify the rest of the captains for someone to second the motion unless a second has already come forward.
  - (3) Upon receipt of an official veto, the CRC will organize a vote amongst the captains in private through a form with a deadline for voting. The results will be announced at the stated deadline or when the final vote is cast, whichever occurs first.
  - (4) There may be more than one veto requested at one time. Timelines will be entirely at the discretion of the CRC.
  - (5) A successful veto will be decided by a 2/3 vote in favor of the veto. Captains who fail to vote will be counted as against the veto.
    - (a) If a veto involves a player on a specific roster or the standings points of a specific team, the captain of that team will be ineligible to vote in the relevant veto unless otherwise granted permission to vote by the CRC.
  
#### Section D - Vote of No Confidence (VONC)
  - (1) At any point in the season, a captain will be allowed to formally request a vote of no-confidence for a CRC member. If the request is seconded by another captain, a vote will be held.
    - (a) If at least 75% of captains vote in favor of the CRC member’s removal, the CRC member’s position will be voted on by the remaining four CRC members. If 3 of the remaining CRC members vote in favor of removing the CRC member, they will be removed from the CRC immediately. If the CRC members do not vote in favor, the member is not removed, but automatically retires at the conclusion of the season.
    - (b) In the event of this, the CRC member must wait at least 1 full season before running for re-election to the CRC.
    - (c) See [Article II, Section A, Part 5](#section-a---the-committee-for-rules-and-coordination-crc) for vacancy information.

### Article XIII - Appendix
  - (1) Teams are subject to punishment if their players or captains partake in any of the following: violation of the DBAD rule, spam on Discord, spam on Reddit, or any other action that breaks the NALTP rules.
  - (2) In the event of a forfeit of a match, the wins and losses will count as usual in the standings, with the cap differential for the winning and losing team being the third-largest positive and negative cap differential for all other matches that week, respectively. If only one game is forfeited, the cap differential will be the third-largest differential for that game of the week. (Ex. If Game 2 is a forfeit, the cap diff is that of all other Game 2's for that week.)
  - (3) The NALTP CRC may demand full access to a team's subreddit (including modmail), Discord, or other form of communication without needing to provide a reason, and shall be granted this access with speed.
  - (4) The CRC agrees that an attack against one or more of them on the subreddit, Discord, or any other public forum shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an attack occurs, each of them will assist the CRC Member or Members so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other CRC Members, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the CRC.
  - (5) Any player who becomes banned from playing TagPro will be ineligible to play in NALTP. They may remain on the roster and resume playing when they are no longer banned from TagPro. Playing on an alternate account to avoid the ban will result in league punishment and referral to the TagPro Moderators.
  - (6) The CRC has the right to interpret rules on a case-by-case basis for the sake of the league’s integrity and competitiveness.
